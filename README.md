Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\

# React Router
-npm install react-router-dom
- (React Router is a tool which allows you to link the landing page of your website to components which render like separate pages but are in fact parts of the same page. For example, you can use React Router to connect www.awesomewebsite.com to www.awesomewebsite.com/whyweareawesome (donâ€™t try to click on these links, this is not a real website.))
# History (React Router)
The history library lets you easily manage session history anywhere JavaScript runs. A history object abstracts away the differences in various environments and provides a minimal API that lets you manage the history stack, navigate, and persist state between sessions.
